# Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)

This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using PyTorch. The GAN is trained to generate synthetic data by learning the underlying distribution of a dataset.

## Features
- **Generator and Discriminator Models:** Implements standard architectures for GAN components.
- **Configurable Parameters:** Includes adjustable batch size, noise dimension, learning rate, and training epochs.
- **Training Process:** Demonstrates the training loop with loss visualization for both generator and discriminator.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- tqdm

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
